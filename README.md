# SageMaker Deployment Project

The starting point for this repo was from https://github.com/udacity/sagemaker-deployment.

This project trains and deploys a sentiment analysis model on SageMaker. 
I use the Serverless Framework for deploying a Lambda, with which I create a POST request using API Gateway.
